## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed DESCRIPTION title from *A Package to Time Your Codes* to *Time Your Codes*

* Modified DESCRIPTION description so it's less wordy.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10(x86_64), R 3.5.2 and R 3.6.0(R-Devel)
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
